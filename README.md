# About me

Hello there! I'm UltraCookie! I'm from Germany and I'm a [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [C](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(Programmiersprache)), [HTML](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language), [CSS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and [Java](https://www.java.com/de/) developer, [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeIM39CTf2D6_NqZOyyLx7w), [Anime](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)/[Manga](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) Fan and [Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing)/[Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing) editor. I spend my most free time with computers, especially [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming). I play a lot of video games such as [Minecraft](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) or other [open world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world) games.

## My programming carreer

I'm mainly programming since I am 11 years old. With 11 years I started with [Swift](https://www.apple.com/de/swift/)(Apples IOS language) on an 2014 IPad. Not long after that I got my first Computer(A Toshiba Laptop) on which I began with the programming language [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). It was a hard start(I definitely don't recommend Javascript as first language) but I got used to it after some time. And again not long after that I began learning [HTML](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language) and [CSS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)(I still hate CSS) and started with developing some basic websites. As a birthday present for my 12th bday I got my own [domain](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(Internet)) and a basic [web server](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webserver). I hosted quite a lot different websites on my domain until I cancelled it and bought a more professional Virtual Private Server([VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server)). With 13 I programmed still a lot using [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) but since I played a lot [Minecraft](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) I also began with [Java](https://www.java.com/de/). I hosted my own server on which I tested my own plugins and I can say this is definitely the best start for Java if you already know the basic concept of programming! With 13 and a half I quit programming for more than half a year but it didn't take long until I picked it up again. With 14 I bought a high-end PC that I have saved quiet a long time for(specs down below at my setup info). I took a course called [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/) at Harvard College. Since then I am programming all kinds of things but mostly I use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for web based development. This course opened my eyes! I learned more than I have learned in the three years before it, it was totally worth it!
